# Wardrobe Manager
A simple app that allows you to keep track your clothing purchases and takes inventory on what are the most common colors in your wardrobe (too many earth-tone items? time to consider getting brighter colors!).

Just take a picture/upload a picture of your purchase or scan barcode of your item, the app makes use of Clarifai models to detect colors and apparel types from the images, so you don't have to fill out those details, making your record keeping as easy as possible. Might add more features in the future that allows wishlisting and outfit suggestions.
